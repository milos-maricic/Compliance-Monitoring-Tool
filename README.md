# AI Regulation and Compliance Monitoring Tool

This tool helps organizations assess compliance with AI regulation standards by checking datasets for potential bias and analyzing model interpretability. It generates a compliance report to highlight any regulatory risks related to biased data distribution and lack of model transparency.

## Features
- **Bias Check**: Analyze protected attributes (e.g., gender, race) for data imbalances.
- **Model Explainability**: If a model is provided, the tool calculates feature importance for better interpretability.
- **Compliance Report**: Summarizes findings related to bias and interpretability, helping organizations assess their AI systems' compliance.

## How It Works
1. **Input Data**: Load a dataset with protected attributes (e.g., gender, race).
2. **Bias Analysis**: The tool checks if any attribute dominates the dataset and flags potential issues.
3. **Model Interpretability**: If a model is provided, the tool calculates feature importance to assess transparency.
4. **Compliance Report**: A report is generated that summarizes any potential compliance issues.

## Example Usage
```python
# Load dataset and define protected attributes
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'gender': np.random.choice(['male', 'female'], size=100),
    'race': np.random.choice(['group_1', 'group_2', 'group_3'], size=100),
    'age': np.random.randint(18, 70, size=100),
    'income': np.random.randint(20000, 100000, size=100)
})

# Simulated feature importance for a model
feature_importances = np.random.rand(4)
model = type('Model', (object,), {'feature_importances_': feature_importances})()

# Generate compliance report
protected_columns = ['gender', 'race']
compliance_report = generate_compliance_report(data, protected_columns, model, ['gender', 'race', 'age', 'income'])
```
